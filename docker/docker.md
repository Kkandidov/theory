<summary>1. What is the difference between a container and a virtual machine?</summary> 

#
**Containers:**
Imagine a container as a self-contained box for your application. It shares the basic building blocks (like the operating system) with other containers on the same system, 
but it has its own space to work without affecting its neighbors. This keeps things lightweight and allows your application to run the same way no matter where you put it.

**Virtual Machines:**
A virtual machine is like having a whole separate computer inside your computer. It has its own operating system, just like a physical machine, and can run completely independent
of everything else. This gives you a lot of control and isolation, but it also uses more resources than a container.

<summary>3. What is the docker daemon?</summary> 

<br/>

The Docker daemon is the workhorse behind the scenes in Docker:
<br/>

**Analogy:** Imagine it as the **factory manager** in a containerized application world.
<br/>

**Technical Definition:** It's a persistent background process that manages all the essential Docker objects:
- Images (the blueprints)
- Containers (the running instances)expand_more
- Networks (how containers communicate)expand_more
- Volumes (persistent storage for containers)
<br/>

**Functionality:**
- Listens for instructions from the Docker client (your commands)
- Handles the heavy lifting: building, running, and managing containers based on those instructions
- Communicates with the underlying operating system to allocate resources and ensure everything runs smoothly

**In short, the Docker daemon is the engine that turns your Docker commands into reality.**

<summary>4. What is the docker client?</summary>

<br/>

The Docker client is your interface for interacting with the Docker world:
<br/>

**Analogy:** Think of it as the foreman giving orders in the containerized application factory.
<br/>

**Technical Definition:** It's a command-line tool (docker) or a graphical user interface (Docker Desktop) that allows you to send commands to the Docker daemon.
<br/>

**Functionality:**
- Provides a way to issue commands for various Docker operations:
- Building container images from instructions.
- Running containers from existing images.
- Managing running containers (starting, stopping, restarting).
- Viewing information about images and containers.
- Interacting with Docker registries to pull and push images.
- Acts as a translator, converting your high-level commands into instructions the Docker daemon (the factory manager) understands.

Can connect to and manage multiple Docker daemons on different machines.
Essentially, the Docker client is the tool you use to tell Docker what you want it to do, and it relays those instructions to the Docker daemon for execution.
