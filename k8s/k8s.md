<summary>2. Tell about a traditional deployment era</summary> 

#
Early on, applications were deployed directly on physical servers, also known as bare metal. At that time, there was no way to define clear resource boundaries between applications running on the same server. This led to resource allocation issues, where one application could consume most of the resources, causing performance problems for others. As a result, the only solution at the time was to allocate each application a separate server. However, this approach had two major drawbacks. Firstly, it wasn't scalable because resources were underutilized. Secondly, maintaining many physical servers was extremely expensive for organizations.
